# **Hardcore modpack, that will leave you satisfied.**

Refactory is a hardcore technology-focused modpack where GregTech Quantum is tightly interwoven with magic, research, and slow, deliberate progression.

This is not “just another tech pack.”
Refactory is a modpack where every machine, every material, and every upgrade must be earned.

The modpack offers a unique and hardcore experience that will definitely leave you satisfied! There are different progression paths, meaning you can play in different ways and are free (partially) from linear progression.

# **Core Design Philosophy**

**Refactory is built around three fundamental aspects:**

### Deep Technological Progression

The backbone of the pack is GregTech Quantum CEu (Modern)
Multi-stage development, from primitive to high-tier machines
Strong focus on infrastructure, automation, and scaling, rather than fast or cheap crafting

### Magic as Part of Industry

Certain technologies are impossible without magical resources
Unlocks alternative progression paths

### Thoughtful Game Design

Carefully rebalanced recipes
Cheat-like items removed
Progression is non-linear — players make meaningful choices instead of following a single guided path

# **Exclusive Content**

Modpack features custom content created specifically for the modpack:

New GregTech Quantum multiblock machines
Unique resource processing chains
New materials and alloys
Magic–technology integrations

Part of this content is implemented through Core-Mod and Jenny Mod.

Currently very unfinished, but join our discord to help me improve my pack!

# Inspiration

The modpack was inspired by Cosmic Frontiers and contains similar gameplay elements!
