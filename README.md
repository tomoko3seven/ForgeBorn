A WIP GregTech modpack. /n
GregTech, Botania, Ars Noveau, Blood Magic.

# **Hardcore modpack, that will leave you satisfied.**
is a hardcore technology-focused modpack where GregTech is tightly interwoven with magic, research, and slow, deliberate progression.

This is not “just another tech pack.”
ForgeBorn is a modpack where every machine, every material, and every upgrade must be earned.

The modpack offers a unique and hardcore experience that will definitely leave you satisfied! There are different progression paths, meaning you can play in different ways and are free (partially) from linear progression.

# **Core Design Philosophy**

**ForgeBorn is built around three fundamental aspects:**


### Deep Technological Progression

 

The backbone of the pack is GregTech CEu (Modern)
Multi-stage development, from primitive to high-tier machines
Strong focus on infrastructure, automation, and scaling, rather than fast or cheap crafting
Magic as Part of Industry

 

Certain technologies are impossible without magical resources
Unlocks alternative progression paths
Thoughtful Game Design

 

Carefully rebalanced recipes
Cheat-like items removed
Progression is non-linear — players make meaningful choices instead of following a single guided path
 

### Exclusive Content

Modpack features custom content created specifically for the modpack:

New GregTech multiblock machines
Unique resource processing chains
New materials and alloys
Magic–technology integrations
Part of this content is implemented through Core-Mod and KubeJS.



Currently very unfinished, but join our discord to help me improve my pack!
